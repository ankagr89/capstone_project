# Detecting Credit Card Transaction Fraud using Machine Learning
Consumers lost over $6 billion to online credity card fraud in 2021 as per the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/borrower-beware-credit-card-fraud-attempts-rise-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-11590571800). Therefore, there is a need to develop tools that can 
alert customers and banks when such type of fradulent activity is attempted as a prevetitive measure. Treating fraudulent and non-fradulent transactions as distinct classes, this problem can be boiled down to a classification task through machine learning. 
Another problem that can be foreseen while developing machine learning based tools to prevent fradulent transactions is that credit card transaction data contains highly confidential personal information. Therefore, access to credit card transaction data is highly restricted
With these motivations, this notebook showcases a two step case study illustrating the power of machine learning in detecting credit card transaction fraud. In the first step, synthetic data using [Sparkov Data Generator](https://github.com/namebrandon/Sparkov_Data_Generation) 
was generated for 750 customers from 1-1-2019 to 12-31-2021 for almost 1 million unique transactions. The generated data resembles realistic credit card transaction data and can be used for training machine learning models. The feature engineering and data augmentation techniques 
such as SMOTE can be applied to improve model performance on real life data for classification of fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions.
